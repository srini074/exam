Normalize this table into 3NF (Third Normal Form). Specify all primary keys, foreign key constraints, unique constraints, not null constraints, and check constraints.

### ER Diagram (5 Marks)

27. Using the normalized tables from Question 27, create an ER diagram. Include the entities, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, not null constraints, and check constraints. Indicate the associations using proper ER diagram notation.
